// Importing all exports from core.js
import * as core from './core.js'

// Importing all exports from curves.js
import * as curves from './curves.js'

// Importing all exports from algorithms.js
import * as algorithms from './algorithms.js'

// Importing all exports from protocols.js
import * as protocols from './protocols.js'

// Now you can access all exports from each file
